## Baybayin OCR Update :tada:

In relation to my [previous publication about Baybayin OCR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09469), I'm excited to announce that me and my colleagues, along with our mentor for this project, Dr. Macario Cordel II, are gearing for an extension publication on this work. As of now, we're still unsure of whether or not we're going to gear up for a conference publication or a journal publication, but we're definitely excited to share our work with the world -- especially in the ASEAN.
<br /><br/>
I cannot delve much into the details of it yet as experimentation is still ongoing, but since at least 70% of new content are needed to consider it a new publication in relation to our previously published conferece paper, you can definitely look forward to seeing much more improvements and a greater scope of the project.

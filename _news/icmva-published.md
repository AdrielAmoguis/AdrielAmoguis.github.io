## The ICMVA 2023 Proceedings are now published!

And that's a wrap! The ICMVA 2023 proceedings are now published in the ACM Digital Library. You can find my paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3589572.3589582). I'm excited to see my work published in the SCOPUS database. I'll be updating my [publications page](/publications) with the ACM Author-Ized PDF soon, but the publication entry is there should you want to see it. :tada:

<br /><br />

I genuinely hope that this work can contribute to the field of traffic systems. Since this is only a small subset of the work I'm doing for my undergraduate thesis, I'm excited to see how the rest of my work will contribute to the field. I'm also hoping that we're able to publish our finished thesis work either in a journal, or another conference.

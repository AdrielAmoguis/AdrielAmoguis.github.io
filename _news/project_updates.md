## Update on Current Projects

I am pleased to announce the completion and acceptance of my undergraduate thesis entitled, "Road Lane Segmentation and Functionality Detection". This is a super-study of our previously published research article in ICMVA 2023, "Road Lane Segmentation Using Vehicle Trajectory Tracking and Lane Demarcation Lines".

<br /><br />

We are currently aiming for publication of a conference paper version of our thesis in the [29th IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision In Practice (M2VIP 2023)](https://www.m2vip.org/) taking place this 21st to 24th of November, 2023.

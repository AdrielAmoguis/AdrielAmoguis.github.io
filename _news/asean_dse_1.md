## ASEAN DSE Competition

I'm announcing today my participation in the [2023 ASEAN Data Science Explorers Competition](https://aseandse.org). I'm participating with my teammate [Naomi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomi-francesca-villanueva-30676723a/?originalSubdomain=ph) from Davao Doctors' College.
<br/><br/>

The competition is a data analytics competition that aims to empower the youth of the ASEAN region to contribute to the ASEAN Community's efforts in addressing socio-economic issues in the region. The competition is open to all tertiary students from the 10 ASEAN member states and challenges them to deliver data-driven insights to solve regional issues. The competition is organized by the ASEAN Foundation and SAP, in partnership with the ASEAN University Network (AUN) and supported by the ASEAN Secretariat.
<br/><br/>

I'm excited to be participating in this competition and I'm looking forward to the results of our work. I'll be posting updates on this blog as the competition progresses. We cannot share much right now as we're still in the process of making our SAP Storyboards, but I'll be sure to share our work here once the competition is over.
<br/><br/>

Hoping for the best, and I hope our work can contribute to the ASEAN Community's efforts in addressing socio-economic issues in the region. :tada:

## Baybayin OCR Update

Experiments are ongoing now for the extension study of our Baybayin OCR system. As a publication goal, we have identified [PACLIC 2023](https://paclic2023.github.io/) as our target conference. This conference will be in Hong Kong this December.

<br /><br />

We are eagerly working on our experiments, and really hope to participate in this conference. The date to beat for our finished paper is July 16, 2023. Will give an update by then!

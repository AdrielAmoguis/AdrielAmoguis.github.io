## Publication in ICMVA 2023 :partying_face:

I am excited to announce my contribution and participation in the [6th International Conference for Machine Vision and Applications (ICMVA 2023)](http://icmva.org)! This is a SCOPUS-indexed conference, and I am honored to be a part of it. I am also delighted to have been able to network with other professionals in my field globally through this conference.
<br/><br/>
I presented a subset of my undergraduate thesis work entitled, "Road Lane Segmentation Using Vehicle Trajectory Tracking and Lane Demarcation Lines." The work is to published in the ICMVA 2023 proceedings, and I am excited to see it published in the SCOPUS database under the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library. I'll definitely be sharing the details in [my publications page](/publications) once it's published.
